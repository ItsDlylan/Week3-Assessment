The web works with strings of servers and clients. A client being any users computer and a server being a place that is hosting files such as: webpages, sites, or apps; for the client to download. When a client wants to access a webpage a copy of the webpage is downloaded from the server onto the clients machine which then displays it in the user's browser.  

What happens behind the scenes is that the browser goes to the DNS server, and finds the real address in a string of numbers seperated by (.)'s which the website lives on. Then the browser sends an HTTP request to the server asking for a copy of the website to the client, then the message and all otehr data between the client and the server is sent across the clients internet connection using TCP/IP. IF the server approves of the request itll send the client a "200 OK" message and starts sending the websites files in a series of data packets (small chunks), The browser assembles the packets back together like a big ol puzzle and displays it to the client.
